<h1>Placeholder Site for Nathan McLaughlin</h1>
<p>I am currently moving my personal site from standard hosting and a Drupal 7 installation to GitHub pages. I no longer have enough time to maintain Drupal and have no need for the awesome features it provides.</p>
<p>I will probably end up using Jekyll for site generation. I will, however, try other flavors during this research period. Once all of that is doen, I will change DNS records to point here in January 2015.</p>
